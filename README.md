# SecureMessage

---

SecureMessage is a compact project that demonstrates the implementation of classic encryption techniques. It includes basic algorithms like Caesar, Vigenère, Substitution, and XOR ciphers, providing a straightforward way to encrypt and decrypt messages. Ideal for educational purposes, it serves as a practical introduction to the basics of cryptography.

## Features

- Implements four classic encryption methods:
    - **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
    - **Vigenère Cipher**: Uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext, resulting in a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.
    - **Substitution Cipher**: A cipher that creates a fixed substitution for the alphabet.
    - **XOR Cipher**: A cipher that applies the XOR logical operation on text using a given key.

- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Input validation to ensure the correct format and values.
- Unit tests for each cipher to ensure reliability and correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with SecureMessage, clone the repository and compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler:

```
git clone git@github.com:xFusek/SecureMessage.git
